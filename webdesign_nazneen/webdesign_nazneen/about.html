                    <h2> Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Development</h2>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

                
                According to a study published in Nature, AI could help achieve 79 % of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This technology could become a key tool for facilitating a circular economy and building smart cities that use their resources efficiently.
                    A clear example of AI's contribution to sustainability is traffic management. Applying Artificial Intelligence in urban mobility allows traffic jams to be predicted and alternative routes to be suggested. With shared mobility, this technology predicts vehicle demand by zone and time. This means that companies can organise the availability of vehicles for citizens based on their needs. This solution not only facilitates mobility, but also minimises its environmental impact. 
                    </p>
                
                 <h2>The alliance between Artificial Intelligence and a sustainable economy</h2>
                 <p> AI can also help enhance the efficiency of renewable energies. Companies are already using this technology to find out the daily availability of energy-generating facilities (wind turbines, hydraulic plants, biomass plants etc.), in order to predict the energy production required to be produced in the coming days and, ultimately, to prevent and diagnose breakdowns.
                    Beyond the energy sector, there are many industries and businesses that can improve thanks to AI, all while helping the planet. In agriculture, for example, it is used to make irrigation and fertilisation more efficient. Thanks to humidity, temperature and fertilisation sensors, Artificial Intelligence is able to predict crops' needs. The most innovative solutions within agricultural sustainability are drones that help farmers with surveillance, in addition to hyperspectral image analysis for comprehensive pest control.

                       <h2> Introducing AI Ethics and Sustainable Development (AIESD)</h2>
                        <p class="last-paragraph">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered to be an enabling technology for the sustainable development of the society and ecology. While ethical challenges on the development and use of AI have already been an important and continuing issue all over the world. How to make good use of AI and avoid potential negative impacts are essential for the future of humanity and ecology.
        The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) are set to solve development issues in economic, social and environmental dimensions. The SDGs call for action by "all countries - poor, rich and middle-income - to promote prosperity while protecting the planet." In all the areas related to SDGs, Artificial Intelligence has a great role to play. It can contribute positively to realize the goals, while it also can bring negative challenges. A more systematic attempt to harness the potential and mitigate the risk of AI for SDGs are needed from the perspective of Ethics and Governance.
        Hence, the International Conferences on AI Ethics and Sustainable Development (AIESD) is aimed at creating a platform for global dialogues and discussions on timely and long term issues related to AI Ethics and Governance under the context of sustainable development of humanity, society, and ecology. The conference series aimed at promoting reaching, implementing global consensus, and sharing best practices related to AI Ethics and Sustainable Development.
